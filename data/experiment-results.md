## Set specification

You need to implement a generic Set collection containing unique elements of arbitrary types. The collection should support operations for adding, removing, and checking the existence of an element. It’s worth noting that all operations on the set should be idempotent. Additionally, there should be a way to obtain the total number of elements in the set. It is not required to implement operations on sets, iterators, converters to other collection types, etc.

Feature: Generic Set Collection

  Scenario: Adding elements to the set
    Given an empty set collection
    When elements of arbitrary types are added to the set
    Then the set contains only unique elements of those types
    And the total number of elements in the set increases accordingly

  Scenario: Removing elements from the set
    Given a set collection with elements
    When elements are removed from the set
    Then the set remains with only unique elements
    And the total number of elements in the set decreases accordingly

  Scenario: Checking existence of an element in the set
    Given a set collection with elements
    When checking the existence of a specific element
    Then it indicates whether the element is present in the set or not

  Scenario: Idempotent operations on the set
    Given a set collection with elements
    When performing any operation on the set
    Then the set remains unchanged if the operation is repeated
    And the total number of elements in the set remains the same

  Scenario: Obtaining the total number of elements in the set
    Given a set collection with elements
    When obtaining the total number of elements in the set
    Then it returns the accurate count of unique elements in the set

```gherkin
As a developer, I want to create a generic Set collection that can store unique elements of any type. The collection should provide the following functionality:

1. Add an element to the Set:
When I call the `add` method with an element,
Then the element should be added to the Set.

2. Remove an element from the Set:
When I call the `remove` method with an element,
Then the element should be removed from the Set.

3. Check if an element exists in the Set:
When I call the `contains` method with an element,
Then the method should return `true` if the element is in the Set, otherwise `false`.

4. Ensure idempotency of all operations:
When I call any of the `add`, `remove`, or `contains` methods multiple times with the same element,
Then the result should be the same as if I called the method only once.

5. Obtain the total number of elements in the Set:
When I call the `size` method,
Then the method should return the number of elements in the Set.

It is not necessary to implement operations on sets, iterators, converters to other collection types, etc.

<!-- TOC --><a name="chatgpt-35-1"></a>

#### ChatGPT 3.5

```latex
Let's formalize the requirements using Floyd-Hoare logic:

1. **Initialization**: The set should be initialized as an empty set.

\[
\{true\} \quad Set() \quad \{set = \emptyset\}
\]

2. **Addition**: Adding an element to the set should result in the element being contained in the set.

\[
\{set = S\} \quad add(element) \quad \{set = S \cup \{element\}\}
\]

3. **Removal**: Removing an element from the set should result in the element no longer being contained in the set.

\[
\{set = S\} \quad remove(element) \quad \{set = S - \{element\}\}
\]

4. **Existence Check**: Checking for the existence of an element in the set should return true if the element is present, and false otherwise.

\[
\{set = S\} \quad contains(element) \quad \{result = (element \in S)\}
\]

5. **Idempotent Operations**: All operations (addition, removal, existence check) should be idempotent, meaning repeating an operation should not change the state of the set.

\[
\{set = S\} \quad \text{add}(element) \quad \{set = S\}
\]
\[
\{set = S\} \quad \text{remove}(element) \quad \{set = S\}
\]
\[
\{set = S\} \quad \text{contains}(element) \quad \{set = S\}
\]

6. **Counting**: There should be a function to obtain the total number of elements in the set.

\[
\{set = S\} \quad \text{count}() \quad \{result = |S|\}
\]

This set of specifications ensures that the Set collection behaves as intended, covering all the original requirements without redundancy.

Definition of a generic Set collection containing unique elements of arbitrary types:

Inductive Set : Type -> Type :=
| Empty : Set T
| Add : T -> Set T -> Set T.

Operations for adding, removing, and checking the existence of an element:

Definition add (s : Set T) (x : T) : Set T :=
  match s with
  | Empty => Add x Empty
  | Add y s' => if (eqb x y) then s else Add x s'
  end.

Definition remove (s : Set T) (x : T) : Set T :=
  match s with
  | Empty => Empty
  | Add y s' => if (eqb x y) then s' else Add y (remove s' x)
  end.

Definition contains (s : Set T) (x : T) : bool :=
  match s with
  | Empty => false
  | Add y s' => if (eqb x y) then true else contains s' x
  end.

Idempotence of operations on the set:

Lemma add_idempotent : forall (s : Set T) (x : T), add (add s x) x = add s x.

## CCT Code Dialog specification

You should implement an application of dialog for selecting the currency transaction type (CTT) code for use on payment forms for outgoing currency payments, outgoing payments in rubles to non-resident entities, on the form of order for transfer currency funds received from a transit account to a current account.
It should be possible to change the list of CTT codes and its textual descriptions without code base contribution and application redeployment. Thus the list of available CTT codes should be deployed  to CDN as a separate resource file. The application should rely on a local caching mechanism to reduce redundant network load.
All CTT codes should be grouped into sections according to the grouping in the appendix to Central Bank Instruction 181-I.
The dialog should include the ability to search for CTT codes by numerical code and by textual description. The search query input field should support quick clearing.
When a user selects one of the CTT codes in the list, the dialog should pass the selected value to the parent application and close. Whenever a user closes the dialog directly with an appropriate button or clicks on a backdrop of the modal window, the dialog should close with a nullish value passed to the host callee application.
The application should support sending product analytics events (opening, searching, selecting CTT).

#### Question

Convert this informal natural language description of program entity's desired behavior to complete and accurate formal specification written in correct Floyd—Hoare logic formulae notation (with pre- and postconditions) with all original requirements covered without any redundant comments:

You should implement an application of dialog for selecting the currency transaction type (CTT) code for use on payment forms for outgoing currency payments, outgoing payments in rubles to non-resident entities, on the form of order for transfer currency funds received from a transit account to a current account.
The dialog should open as a modal window with a set of parameters that determine its display and behavior. The dialog should interact with the parent application using events. It should be possible to pass a payment type parameter to the dialog while opening (values: incoming currency, outgoing currency, or outgoing ruble). Based on this parameter, a preliminary filtering of codes should be performed to simplify the user's selection of the code for their payment. You should keep in mind the possible necessity to extend the number of parameters passed in the future.
It should be possible to change the list of CTT codes and its textual descriptions without code base contribution and application redeployment. Thus the list of available CTT codes should be deployed  to CDN as a separate resource file. The application should rely on a local caching mechanism to reduce redundant network load.
All CTT codes should be grouped into sections according to the grouping in the appendix to Central Bank Instruction 181-I.
The dialog should include the ability to search for CTT codes by numerical code and by textual description. The search query input field should support quick clearing.
When a user selects one of the CTT codes in the list, the dialog should pass the selected value to the parent application and close. Whenever a user closes the dialog directly with an appropriate button or clicks on a backdrop of the modal window, the dialog should close with a nullish value passed to the host callee application.
The application should support sending product analytics events (opening, searching, selecting CTT).
