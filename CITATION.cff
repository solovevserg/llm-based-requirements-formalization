abstract: >-
  The paper addresses the possible applications of large
  language models (LLMs) to automate requirements
  formalization, a very challenging aspect in the system
  development life cycle. Requirements formalization is a
  technique of casting specification to strict formal
  notation to avoid miscommunication and encourage formal
  verification, but requires a lot of work. The author
  explores possible application of text-based neural
  networks to automate the process and reduce time costs. He
  compares the result of automated conversion of
  requirements to different formal notations by two popular
  LLM-based chat assistants according to five criteria.
  Despite the modest performance observed in the current
  experiment, the demonstrated potential of LLM in
  requirements formalization promises to lead us to highly
  automated requirements engineering pipelines and more
  efficient reliable system development process.
